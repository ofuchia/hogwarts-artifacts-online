# Hogwarts Artifacts Online - Spring Boot Application

What is üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hogwarts Artifacts Online üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è?

Welcome to Hogwarts Artifacts Online, a sample back-end application designed to demonstrate typical use cases and best practices in Spring Boot development.

Throughout the course, Hogwarts Artifacts Online serves as a running example and is developed progressively. 

Through building this project, I leared how to frame user stories, craft REST APIs and apply object-oriented design principles. Embracing test-driven development, I built and refined each feature. At the end, I set up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, ensuring smooth deployment of the application.

Gain practical experience in:

Dependency Injection and the use of Spring Framework's core container.
Building the web layer with Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller).
Data persistence in relational databases using Spring Data JPA (Jakarta Persistence API).
User authentication and authorization with Spring Security and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Deploying a Spring Boot application to a cloud platform with Spring Cloud Azure.
Monitoring a running Spring Boot application in the production with Spring Boot Actuator.
Making requests to OpenAI API with RestClient.
Paging and sorting.
Writing dynamic queries with Spring Data JPA Specifications.

Emphasized good software engineering practices, such as:

Defining software requirements with User Stories.
Version control and project planning using Git and GitHub.
The API-First Approach in designing effective REST APIs.
Test-Driven Development (TDD): writing tests first, then coding to pass the tests, and refactoring.
Object-Oriented Design with UML.
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) with GitHub Actions.
